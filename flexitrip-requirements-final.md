## Product Vision

### Mission Statement
Create an AI-powered travel planning application that eliminates the complexity of planning trips for families with diverse age groups - from toddlers to grandparents.

### Core Value Proposition
FlexiTrip understands that planning for a 5-year-old AND a 75-year-old requires different considerations. Our AI generates recommendations that work for everyone in the family, considering mobility, interests, cultural preferences, and dietary needs.

### Target Users
- **Primary**: Multi-generational families (grandparents + parents + children)
- **Secondary**: Parents planning with young children (5-12 years)
- **Tertiary**: Adult children planning for elderly parents (65+)
- **Quaternary**: Large family groups with diverse needs

### Success Vision
By launch + 3 months:
- 500+ families have successfully planned trips using FlexiTrip
- 80%+ user satisfaction with age-appropriate recommendations
- 40%+ of trips planned involve 3+ different age groups
- Self-sustaining operation within $50/month budget
