# Enhanced Prompt Generation - Implementation Summary

## ðŸŽ¯ **What Was Enhanced**

The prompt generation system now automatically incorporates **cultural population insights** and **accessibility considerations** directly into the base prompts, creating more detailed and culturally-aware queries for better LLM responses.

## âœ… **Key Improvements**

### **1. Cultural Population Insights**
Base prompts now automatically include specific cultural preferences and community-frequented venues:

**Indian/South Asian Family Example:**
- **Before:** "I'm planning a trip to Chicago for 3 adults and 1 senior"
- **After:** "I'm planning a trip to Chicago for 3 adults and 1 senior. Please prioritize vegetarian-friendly dining with authentic Indian/South Asian restaurants, Hindu temples or cultural centers, traditional spice markets, and venues with comfortable seating for seniors"

### **2. Family Accessibility Considerations**
Prompts automatically include accessibility and age-specific needs:

**Multi-Generational Group Example:**
- **Seniors Present:** "We prefer venues that prioritize venues with comfortable seating, elevators or ramps, and shorter walking distances, recommend quieter time slots and mention any senior or accessibility discounts"
- **Children Present:** "We prefer venues that include family-friendly activities with interactive experiences"
- **Low Mobility:** "We prefer venues that ensure wheelchair accessibility, avoid stairs-only access, and suggest reserve-ahead options"
